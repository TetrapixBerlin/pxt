# Extension Approval

Only approved extensions may be surfaced in search results in the ``Extensions`` dialog.
GitHub Organizations or GitHub repos can be approved.

Banned extensions are not allowed to be loaded.

## Checklist

Whenever you are submitting an extension for approval, please check that you have completed the following tasks:

- [ ] A release has been created in GitHub. You can create a release of the extension when syncing in the MakeCode editor or using the **pxt bump** cli command. The format **must** be ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.
- [ ] An icon image **icon.png** is available in the root folder. It should be 300x200 pixels and **less than 100kb** in size.
- [ ] A GitHub repo description added that's descriptive enough to help with extension search.
- [ ] A test file, called ``test.ts``, is present and compiles when running **pxt deploy**.
- [ ] The ``README.md`` file contains API documentation for the extension blocks.
- [ ] Your public functions and types follow the [MakeCode naming conventions](https://makecode.com/extensions/naming-conventions).
